This is a first attempt trying to make sproutcore use jsdoc v3 instead of jsdoc toolkit v2.4.0n.
At the same time I am trying to create a code intelligence file which can be used with SublimeCodeIntel,
as well as Komodo Edit and Komodo IDE.
You'll need to check out the sproutcore repo in ./sproutcore, and use the team/mauritslamers/jsdocv3 branch.
